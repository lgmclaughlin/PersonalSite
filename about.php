                <h4>About Me</h4>
                <p class="about-p content-p">
                    My name is Lucas McLaughlin. I'm currently a senior studying at 
                    Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts.
                    I'll be graduating in May, 2015 with a BS in computer science.
                    I'm passionate about web-design, specifically in building beautiful,
                    well-structured sites that are natural to use and easy to maintain.

                <h4>Skills</h4>
                <p class="about-p content-p">
                    Through coursework and internships, I've learned
                    how to manage my time, communicate with team members, adapt quickly
                    to new problems and situations, consider the big picture of a project
                    while still focusing on the details, question the norm to find new
                    improvements, and so much more.
                    <br /><br />
                    As a computer scienctist, I've also fought to become proficient in the
                    technologies currently relevant to my field. With my passion in web
                    development, I've mainly focused on and become extremely proficient in 
                    HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, jQuery, Python, and PHP. I've also had 
                    experience with MySQL, C/C++, Java, AngularJS, C#, and Objective-C.
                    Through all of this experimentation with various technologies, I've
                    come to love the challenge of learning a new language, framework,
                    IDE, etc.

                    The last three years at WPI have been some of the best of my life.
                    I've met, learned from, and befriended hundreds of incredibly smart 
                    people. I've enjoyed many fascinating courses that challenged
                    me to push myself harder and think about problems in new, abstract
                    ways. I've been a member of numerous groups on campus such as the 
                    Recording club and the Soccer club. I joined a fraternity (Phi Kappa
                    Theta), something I never imagined myself doing, and even went on to 
                    chair a committee. Through networking and hard work,
                    I interned at three different companies: Bit9, Infor Global Solutions,
                    and Community Healthlink. It's amazing how much can be learned in three
                    years, and everyday I'm so thankful to have gotten the chance
                    to go through college surrounded by such phenomenal people.
