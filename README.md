Synopsis
--------
This is the HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS, jQuery, and all other code and assets behind my personal website. 

Motivation
----------
This project was for fun. The site houses examples of my work in all categories of life in hopes that someone might find it interesting. I wanted to focus on making a site that was
* Beautiful and intuitive
* Responsive to different screen sizes
* Resource light and easily loaded
* Scalable and easy to modify
